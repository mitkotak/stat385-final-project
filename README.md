## Purpose

The purpose of the application is to match flight origin/destination with total delay times grouped by days. Around holiday time (For e.g Christmas), people who might have a bit of a flexibility on when they can fly can minimize their flight delay using this interactive visualization.

## Data

The data is the NYC Flight dataset for the year 2013 where we are using columns origin, dest, arr_delay and dep_delay
